Project 1: RSNA 2022 Cervical Spine Fracture Detection
1. Problem statement: 

Over 1.5 million spine fractures occur annually in the United States alone resulting in over 17,730 spinal cord injuries annually. The most common site of spine fracture is the cervical spine. There has been a rise in the incidence of spinal fractures in the elderly and in this population, fractures can be more difficult to detect on imaging due to superimposed degenerative disease and osteoporosis. Imaging diagnosis of adult spine fractures is now almost exclusively performed with computed tomography (CT) instead of radiographs (x-rays). Quickly detecting and determining the location of any vertebral fractures is essential to prevent neurologic deterioration and paralysis after trauma. This project is about detecting cervical spine fracture, which is using artificial intelligence technology to detect the cervical whether fractured and the location of fraction. Using AI could make quick conclusion details of cervical spine fracture and prevent neurologic deterioration and paralysis.

2. Applications: 

Fractures of the cervical spine are potentially serious and devastating if not properly treated. Cervical spine injury can be associated with high morbidity and mortality, and a delay in diagnosis of an unstable fracture leading to inadequate immobilization may result in a catastrophic decline in neurologic function with devastating consequences. Clearing the cervical spine through imaging is therefore a critical first step in the evaluation of patients with trauma, and multidetector CT has emerged as the standard of care imaging technique to evaluate cervical spine trauma. Morbidity and mortality in patients with cervical spine injury can be reduced through rapid diagnosis and intervention. This can be used in clinical diagnosis of cervical sping detection, helps the doctor cure the patient timely.

3. An area interesting:
The area I think is interesting is to find the fraction location of cervical spine fracture. Because in CT image, spine is made of many small bones, which is hard to detect and locate the fracture. Also, rather than broken leg, cure overdue makes a little influence, spine fracture overdue cure can make the patient neurologic deterioration and paralysis after trauma. The importance of rapid diagnosis patient for patients makes me interested in this topic too.
